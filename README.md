# News-Scrapper
A Very Simple Python Based News Scrapper

This Python Scrapper is a very basic NEWS Scrapper

It uses the API provided by different NewsPapers Online to fetch details
about the current news.

The Library used are - BeautifulSoup for Parsing the HTML text.
                       JSON for parsing the data as a JSON OBJECT.
                       urllib2 for requesting the data.

The Scrapper at the end of the Data parsing puts it into a NEWS.txt file so that 
user can view the LATEST NEWS HEADLINES without having to open the browser.

The Work is still in progress for some changes.
